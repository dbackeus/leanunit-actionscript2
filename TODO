The Dream:

Run the test suite automatically every time a .as file is saved (like autotest in ruby).
Getting as far as to auto-recompile is feasible (but how to run the flash file without duplicating windows and making it cross platform).
Growl support on mac os (would seem out of the question since the flash player can't do those kinds of calls).
Getting crazy and spawning a sinatra webserver that flash could communicate with could do it.

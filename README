=== DESCRIPTION

After wasting too much time trying to figure out ASUnit and feeling sick about how bloated its codebase was I decided to roll my own. This is the result.

=== REQUIREMENTS

- Adobe Flash 7 or higher

(I'm not familiar with other compilers - if you are and have something to add please do)

=== INSTALL

git clone git://github.com/druiden/leanunit-actionscript2.git

Then either copy the leanUnit directory into your source directory or link the cloned directory in your fla classpath (publish settings -> flash -> settings).

=== USAGE

Goes a little something like this...

.Begin with a simple test class.

// StringTest.as
class StringTest extends leanUnit.TestCase
{
	var string:String
	
	function setup()
	{
		string = 'Asdf'
	}
	
	function testLength()
	{
		assertEqual(4, string.length)
	}
	
	function testToUpperCase()
	{
		assertEqual( 'ASDF', string.toUpperCase() )
	}
	
	function teardown()
	{
		delete string
	}
}

.You are using the Flash IDE:

// Framescript
new StringTest().run()

Export the fla and watch the results.

.You are using the MTASC compiler:

// MtascMain.as
class MtascMain
{
	static function main(root)
	{
		var st = new StringTest()
		st.run()
	}
}

// From the command line
mtasc -swf example.swf -header 550:400:10:080808 -main MtascMain.as

Then run example.swf and watch the results.

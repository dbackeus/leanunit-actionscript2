=== DESCRIPTION

After wasting too much time trying to figure out ASUnit and feeling sick about how bloated its codebase was I decided to roll my own. This is the result.

=== REQUIREMENTS

- Adobe Flash 7 or higher

(I'm not familiar with other compilers - if you are and have something to add please do)

=== INSTALL

git clone git://github.com/druiden/leanunit-actionscript2.git

Then either copy the leanUnit directory into your source directory or link the cloned directory in your fla classpath (publish settings -> flash -> settings).

=== USAGE

Goes a little something like this. You can also compile 'example.fla' to see it in action.

// StringTest.as
class StringTest extends leanUnit.TestCase
{
	var string:String
	
	function setup()
	{
		string = 'Asdf'
	}
	
	function testLength()
	{
		assertEqual(4, string.length)
	}
	
	function testToUpperCase()
	{
		assertEqual( 'ASDF', string.toUpperCase() )
	}
	
	function teardown()
	{
		delete string
	}
}

// Framescript
new StringTest().run()
